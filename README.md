# Module: MMM-CustomText

`MMM-CustomText` is a module for [MagicMirrorÂ²](https://github.com/MagicMirrorOrg/MagicMirror). It posts any message you want to your MagicMirror.  Multiple instances are supported. Message can be updated via notification.  And messages can include HTML elements including CSS formatting.

![Example Screenshot](screenshot.png)

The main differences between this and [MMM-CustomMessage](https://github.com/jpcaldwell30/MMM-CustomMessage) are that (1) this module allows separately updating multiple instances, (2) this module primarily employs the MagicMirror notification system for updating messages, and (3) this module completely collapses to 0 pixels in height by default when no message is displayed.

Suggestions are welcome.

## Installation

```bash
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules
git clone https://github.com/dathbe/MMM-CustomText
```

No dependencies need to be installed, **but** you likely want [MMM-Remote-Control](https://github.com/Jopyth/MMM-Remote-Control) installed to allow posting of messages via API.

## Updating

```sh
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules/MMM-CustomText
git pull
```

## Usage

### Example Config

To use this module, add it to the modules array in your `~/MagicMirror/config/config.js` file:

````js
{
	module: 'MMM-CustomText',
	position: 'top_bar',
	config: {
		initialMessage: "I posted my first message!",
		uniqueID: "myUniqueID",
		animationSpeed: 1000 * 2,
	},
}
````

### Configuration options

The following properties can be configured:

| Option                | Description
|-----------------------|------------
|`initialMessage`	|*Optional* A message you would like to display when MagicMirror loads<br>**Type:** `string`<br>**Default:** `"No notification received yet"`
|`uniqueID`		|*Optional*, but necessary if you plan to have multiple instances of this module in your config file.  Give each instance a unique `uniqueID` that you can pass in notifications (see below)<br>**Type:** anything<br>**Default:** `null`
|`animationSpeed`	|*Optional* The speed of animated transitions from one message to another in milliseconds<br>**Type:** `int`<br>**Default:** `2000` (2 seconds)

### Posting a message via notification

You can update the message displayed by this module using a `CUSTOMTEXT_UPDATE` notification.  Pass the `message` and, if you have more than one instance of the module, the `uniqueID` of the instance in a json object:

```json
{
	"uniqueID": "myUniqueID",
	"message": "I posted a notification message!"
}
```

For example, if you wanted to create such a notification in python, install the [MMM-Remote-Control](https://github.com/Jopyth/MMM-Remote-Control) module, and then you can execute the following script:

```py
import requests 

accesstoken = 'mYsUpErSeCrEtToKeN'
header = {'Authorization': f"Bearer {accesstoken}", 'Content-type': 'application/json'}
message = 
json = {
	"uniqueID": "myUniqueID",
	"message": "<div style='background-color:#f19b52'>I posted a notification message!</div>"
}
x = requests.post('http://localhost:8080/api/notification/CUSTOMTEXT_UPDATE', json=json, headers=header)
```

### Notes

* Both the initial message and any subsequent message posted by notification **will accept standard HTML elements** within the string.  That means you could, for example, style the message using inline CSS or by giving the message a class name and using `~/MagicMirror/css/custom/css`.  You could also insert more complex elements like a table.
* You can **clear the message** from the display by posting `""` via notification.  If the message is `""`--either via `initialMessage` or a notification posting--it *should* collapse the module so that no unnecessary space is taken up on your display.  If you want the module to take up a fixed height on your display regardless of the length of the message, you should be able to set this in `~/MagicMirror/css/custom.css`.
* **If you only have one instance** of this module in your config (or you want to update all instances at the same time) and you have not set an explicit `uniqueID` in your config, you do *not* need to pass a `uniqueID` in your notification.  The module will update no matter what you pass as `uniqueID`, or if you pass nothing at all.
